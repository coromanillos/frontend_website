      One of the most famous lighthouses of antiquity, as I have already pointed
      out, was the pharos of Alexandria, which ancient writers included among
      the Seven Wonders of the World. It might naturally be supposed that the
      founder of so remarkable a monument of architectural skill would be well
      known; yet while Strabo and Pliny, Eusebius, Suidas, and Lucian ascribe
      its erection to Ptolem√¶us Philadelphus, the wisest and most benevolent of
      the Ptolemean kings of Egypt, by Tzetzes and Ammianus Marcellinus the
      honour is given to Cleopatra; and other authorities even attribute it to
      Alexander the Great.
